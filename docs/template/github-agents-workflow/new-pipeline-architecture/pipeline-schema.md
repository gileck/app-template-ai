# Pipeline Definition Schema

## Storage Decision: Code, Not Database

Pipeline definitions are stored as **const objects in TypeScript**, not in MongoDB. Rationale:

- Definitions change with code releases, not at runtime
- TypeScript provides compile-time validation that transition `from`/`to` reference valid status IDs
- Guard and hook IDs are validated against the registry at startup
- No migration needed — just update the const and deploy
- Pipeline definitions are read-only at runtime — no concurrency concerns

## Core Types

### PipelineDefinition

The top-level type representing a complete pipeline:

```typescript
interface PipelineDefinition {
  id: string;                          // 'feature' | 'bug' | 'task'
  label: string;                       // 'Feature Pipeline'
  entryStatus: string;                 // Status ID where items land after approval.
                                       // For features/tasks: Backlog (needs manual routing).
                                       // For bugs: Bug Investigation (auto-routed on approval).
  terminalStatuses: string[];          // Status IDs where the pipeline is complete
  statuses: PipelineStatus[];
  transitions: PipelineTransition[];
  reviewFlows: ReviewFlowDefinition[];
}
```

### PipelineStatus

Each status in the pipeline:

```typescript
interface PipelineStatus {
  id: string;                          // Maps to STATUSES values: 'Backlog', 'Product Design', etc.
  label: string;                       // Human-readable label
  agentPhase?: string;                 // Agent type that runs in this status (e.g., 'product-design', 'implementation')
  isDesignPhase?: boolean;             // True for Product Dev, Product Design, Bug Investigation, Tech Design
  requiresDecision?: boolean;          // True for Bug Investigation (admin selects fix approach)
}
```

### PipelineTransition

A single valid transition between statuses:

```typescript
interface PipelineTransition {
  id: string;                          // Unique transition ID: 'route-to-product-design', 'merge-impl-pr', etc.
  from: string | '*';                  // Source status ID, or '*' for any-status transitions
  to: string | '*';                    // Target status ID, or '*' for dynamic resolution:
                                       //   - If context.restoreStatus provided: use it (undo)
                                       //   - If context.decisionSelection?.routing?.targetStatus provided: use it (choose-recommended)
                                       //   - If no dynamic target and not a delete: keep current status (no-op like merge-revert-pr)
                                       //   - For delete transitions: item is removed (status irrelevant)
  trigger: TransitionTrigger;          // What causes this transition
  guards?: TransitionGuardRef[];       // Preconditions that must pass
  hooks?: TransitionHookRef[];         // Side effects to execute
  description?: string;               // Human-readable explanation
}
```

### TransitionTrigger

Replaces implicit "who calls what" with explicit trigger types. The engine accepts any `string` as a trigger — pipeline definitions declare their own trigger vocabulary:

```typescript
type TransitionTrigger = string;
```

Known triggers are documented as a const object for convenience, but are **not an engine constraint**:

```typescript
const KNOWN_TRIGGERS = {
  admin_route: 'admin_route',                      // Admin routes item to a destination
  admin_review_approve: 'admin_review_approve',     // Admin approves a design review
  admin_review_changes: 'admin_review_changes',     // Admin requests changes on design
  admin_review_reject: 'admin_review_reject',       // Admin rejects a design
  admin_merge_pr: 'admin_merge_pr',                 // Admin merges implementation PR
  admin_merge_final_pr: 'admin_merge_final_pr',     // Admin merges final PR
  admin_merge_revert_pr: 'admin_merge_revert_pr',   // Admin merges revert PR
  admin_revert: 'admin_revert',                     // Admin reverts a merge
  admin_request_changes_pr: 'admin_request_changes_pr',           // Admin requests changes on impl PR
  admin_request_changes_design_pr: 'admin_request_changes_design_pr', // Admin requests changes on design PR
  admin_mark_done: 'admin_mark_done',               // Admin manually marks Done
  admin_delete: 'admin_delete',                     // Admin deletes item
  admin_undo: 'admin_undo',                         // Admin undoes within time window
  admin_decision: 'admin_decision',                 // Admin submits decision (bug fix selection)
  admin_choose_recommended: 'admin_choose_recommended', // Admin selects recommended option
  admin_clarification_received: 'admin_clarification_received', // Admin marks clarification received
  agent_complete: 'agent_complete',                 // Agent finishes work
  auto_advance: 'auto_advance',                     // System auto-advances approved items
  system_approve: 'system_approve',                 // System processes item approval
  system_phase_advance: 'system_phase_advance',     // System advances to next implementation phase
} as const;
```

Pipeline definitions use these constants (`KNOWN_TRIGGERS.admin_route`), but the engine matches triggers by string equality — new triggers can be added without modifying engine types.

### TransitionGuardRef and TransitionHookRef

References to registered guards and hooks:

```typescript
interface TransitionGuardRef {
  id: string;                          // Guard ID in the registry: 'guard:item-exists'
  params?: Record<string, unknown>;    // Optional parameters passed to guard function
}

interface TransitionHookRef {
  id: string;                          // Hook ID in the registry: 'hook:create-github-issue'
  phase: 'before' | 'after';          // Execute before or after status change
  optional?: boolean;                  // If true, hook failure doesn't block transition
  params?: Record<string, unknown>;    // Optional parameters passed to hook function
}
```

### ReviewFlowDefinition

Governs sub-state (review status) within a pipeline status:

```typescript
interface ReviewFlowDefinition {
  statusId: string;                    // Pipeline status this applies to
  onAgentComplete: {
    reviewStatus: string;              // Review status set when agent finishes
  };
  reviewActions: ReviewAction[];       // Available admin actions
}

interface ReviewAction {
  action: string;                      // 'approve' | 'changes' | 'reject' | 'choose_recommended'
  reviewStatus?: string;               // Review status to set
  triggersTransition?: string;         // Transition ID to fire after setting review status
}
```

### TransitionContext

Runtime data passed through a transition:

```typescript
interface TransitionContext {
  actor?: string;                      // 'admin' | 'agent' | 'system'
  agentType?: string;                  // For agent_complete: 'implementation', 'bug-investigation', etc.
  agentResult?: Record<string, unknown>; // Agent completion data
  destination?: string;                // For routing: 'product-design', 'tech-design', etc.
  designType?: string;                 // For design operations: 'product', 'product-dev', 'tech'
  prNumber?: number;                   // PR number for merge/revert operations
  shortSha?: string;                   // For revert validation
  commitMessage?: string;              // For merge operations
  restoreStatus?: string;              // For undo: status to restore
  restoreReviewStatus?: string;        // For undo: review status to restore
  phase?: string;                      // For multi-phase: '1/3', '2/3', etc.
  decisionSelection?: {               // For decision routing
    optionIndex: number;
    routing?: { destination: string; targetStatus: string };
  };
  sourceRef?: {                        // For approve: source document reference
    collection: string;
    id: string;
  };
  itemType?: string;                   // 'feature' | 'bug' | 'task'
  logAction?: string;                  // Logging action label
  logDescription?: string;             // Logging description
  statusVersion?: number;              // For optimistic concurrency
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;  // Additional context for hooks
}
```

### TransitionContext Field Usage

| Field | Used By Transitions |
|-------|-------------------|
| `actor` | All transitions |
| `destination` | `route-to-*` |
| `prNumber` | `merge-*`, `revert-*` |
| `commitMessage` | `merge-impl-pr*` |
| `restoreStatus` / `restoreReviewStatus` | `undo-action` |
| `shortSha` | `revert-merge` |
| `decisionSelection` | `bug-decision-to-*`, `choose-recommended` |
| `phase` | `merge-impl-pr-next-phase`, `merge-impl-pr-final` |
| `sourceRef` | `approve` |
| `statusVersion` | All (concurrency check) |
| `agentType` / `agentResult` | `agent-complete-*` (set by `completeAgent`) |
| `designType` | `approve-design-*` |
| `itemType` | `approve` (determines pipeline) |
| `logAction` / `logDescription` | All (passed to `hook:agent-log` and `hook:history-log`) |
| `metadata` | Hook-specific additional context |

### TransitionResult

Returned after a transition. The engine populates only generic fields — all domain-specific data lives in `hookResults`:

```typescript
interface TransitionResult {
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
  previousStatus?: string;
  newStatus?: string;
  previousReviewStatus?: string;
  newReviewStatus?: string;
  transitionId: string;
  hookResults?: Array<{
    hookId: string;
    success: boolean;
    error?: string;
    data?: unknown;
  }>;
}
```

Domain-specific data (merge commit SHA, phase info, created PRs, etc.) is returned by hooks in their `data` field. Callers extract what they need from `hookResults` using a helper:

```typescript
// Utility for wrappers to extract typed hook data
function getHookData<T>(result: TransitionResult, hookId: string): T | undefined {
  return result.hookResults?.find(h => h.hookId === hookId)?.data as T | undefined;
}

// Example: merge wrapper extracts commit SHA from hook:merge-pr
const mergeData = getHookData<{ mergeCommitSha: string }>(result, 'hook:merge-pr');
const sha = mergeData?.mergeCommitSha;

// Example: revert wrapper extracts PR info from hook:create-revert-pr
const revertData = getHookData<{ prNumber: number; prUrl: string }>(result, 'hook:create-revert-pr');
```

This keeps the engine fully generic — it never interprets hook return values.

## Key Design Decisions

### Review Status Is a Separate Dimension

Review status (`Waiting for Review`, `Approved`, `Request Changes`, etc.) is **not** a pipeline status. It's a sub-state within a status. This avoids state explosion — instead of needing separate statuses for "Product Design / Waiting for Review" and "Product Design / Approved", the pipeline status remains `Product Design` while the review status tracks the sub-state.

The pipeline engine manages `status`; review status is governed by `ReviewFlowDefinition` within each status. The `engine.updateReviewStatus()` method handles review status changes with validation against the current status's review flow.

### Trigger Types Replace Implicit Caller Identity

The current code has no way to distinguish *who* initiated a status change. The same `advanceStatus()` function is called by admin actions, agent completions, and system auto-advance. Trigger types make this explicit:

- `admin_route` — admin chose a routing destination
- `agent_complete` — an agent finished its phase
- `auto_advance` — the system auto-advanced an approved item

This allows pipeline definitions to restrict certain transitions to certain triggers. For example, `auto_advance` transitions can only fire for statuses that have a defined next-status in `STATUS_TRANSITIONS`.

### Wildcard Transitions for Global Operations

Some operations apply regardless of current status:

- **`from: '*'`** transitions: cancel/delete (any status → removed), manual-mark-done (any status → Done)
- **`from: '*', to: '*'`** transitions have three distinct semantics:

1. **Undo (restore previous status):** `context.restoreStatus` is provided → engine uses it as the target status. Example: `undo-action` restores the status and review status from before the last action.

2. **Decision routing (resolve from recommendation):** `context.decisionSelection?.routing?.targetStatus` is provided → engine uses it as the target status. Example: `choose-recommended` routes to the destination specified by the recommended fix option's routing config.

3. **No-op (keep current status):** No dynamic target in context and transition is not a delete → engine keeps the current status unchanged. The transition runs hooks (cleanup, logging) but doesn't change the pipeline status. Examples: `merge-revert-pr` (merges revert PR, clears revert PR number), `design-pr-request-changes` (only changes review status).

4. **Delete (item removed):** For `delete` transitions → the item is removed from the pipeline entirely via hooks (`hook:delete-workflow-item`). The target status is irrelevant since the item no longer exists.

The engine resolves wildcard targets at runtime using `TransitionContext` data. Guards on wildcard transitions are especially important since they're the only thing preventing invalid state changes.

### Hook Ordering and Failure Tolerance

Hooks have two execution phases:
- **`before`** hooks run before the status change is written. Use these for operations that must succeed for the transition to proceed (e.g., creating a GitHub issue during approval).
- **`after`** hooks run after the status change is written. Use these for side effects that shouldn't block the transition (e.g., sending notifications).

The `optional: boolean` flag controls failure tolerance:
- `optional: false` (default) — hook failure aborts the transition (before hooks) or logs an error (after hooks)
- `optional: true` — hook failure is logged but doesn't affect the transition

This matches the current pattern where operations like Telegram notifications are fire-and-forget while GitHub issue creation is a hard requirement.

### Multi-Match Resolution via Guards

When multiple transitions share the same `trigger + from`, the engine uses **guard-based resolution**: it evaluates each candidate's guards in pipeline definition order and selects the first transition where all guards pass. This keeps the engine fully generic — no domain-specific logic in the engine itself.

This pattern is used for:
- **Merge transitions**: Three transitions share `trigger: admin_merge_pr, from: PR Review`. Phase-inspection guards (`guard:is-single-phase`, `guard:is-middle-phase`, `guard:is-final-phase`) disambiguate which transition to fire.
- **Agent completion**: Two transitions share `trigger: agent_complete, from: Bug Investigation`. The `guard:auto-submit-conditions-met` guard disambiguates between auto-submit and normal completion.

**Pipeline definition order matters** — the first matching transition wins. Place more specific transitions (with more restrictive guards) before generic fallbacks.

The engine exposes multi-match resolution via `transitionByTrigger(issueNumber, trigger, context)`, which finds all transitions matching `trigger + from(currentStatus)`, runs guard-based resolution, and delegates to `transition()`. This is the primary method for callers that know the trigger but not the specific transition ID. See [engine.md](./engine.md) for the full interface.

### Const Objects with Type Safety

Pipeline definitions are TypeScript const objects, not JSON files. This enables:

```typescript
const FEATURE_PIPELINE = {
  id: 'feature',
  statuses: [
    { id: STATUSES.backlog, label: 'Backlog' },
    { id: STATUSES.productDevelopment, label: 'Product Development', isDesignPhase: true, agentPhase: 'product-dev' },
    // ...
  ],
  transitions: [
    {
      id: 'route-to-product-design',
      from: STATUSES.backlog,
      to: STATUSES.productDesign,
      trigger: 'admin_route' as const,
      guards: [{ id: 'guard:item-exists' }, { id: 'guard:github-synced' }],
      hooks: [
        { id: 'hook:sync-workflow-status', phase: 'after' as const },
        { id: 'hook:notify-routed', phase: 'after' as const, optional: true },
      ],
    },
    // ...
  ],
} as const satisfies PipelineDefinition;
```

Using `STATUSES` constants for status IDs ensures pipeline definitions stay in sync with the project management configuration. The `satisfies` keyword provides type checking without losing const narrowing.
