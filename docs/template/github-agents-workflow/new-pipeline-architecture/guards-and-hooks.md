# Guards and Hooks

## Registry Design

Guards and hooks are registered in a central registry at application startup:

```typescript
// pipeline/registry.ts
interface GuardFunction {
  (item: WorkflowItem, transition: PipelineTransition, context: TransitionContext): Promise<{ valid: boolean; reason?: string }>;
}

interface HookFunction {
  (item: WorkflowItem, transition: PipelineTransition, context: TransitionContext, params?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<HookResult>;
}

interface HookResult {
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
  data?: unknown;  // Hook-specific return data (e.g., merge commit SHA, PR URL)
}

class GuardRegistry {
  private guards = new Map<string, GuardFunction>();
  register(id: string, fn: GuardFunction): void;
  get(id: string): GuardFunction;
  has(id: string): boolean;
  validateAll(ids: string[]): void;  // Throws if any ID not registered
}

class HookRegistry {
  private hooks = new Map<string, HookFunction>();
  register(id: string, fn: HookFunction): void;
  get(id: string): HookFunction;
  has(id: string): boolean;
  validateAll(ids: string[]): void;  // Throws if any ID not registered
}
```

At startup, the engine validates that every guard and hook ID referenced in pipeline definitions is registered. This catches typos and missing registrations at boot time, not at runtime.

## Guard Catalog

19 guards derived from current precondition checks across workflow-service functions, plus 4 new guards for generic multi-match resolution:

### Item Guards (`pipeline/guards/item-guards.ts`)

| Guard ID | Derived From | Logic | Used By |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| `guard:item-exists` | Every function | Workflow item exists in GitHub Projects (via `findItemByIssueNumber`) | All transitions except `approve` (item doesn't exist in GitHub Projects yet during approval) |
| `guard:not-double-approved` | `approve.ts` | Item doesn't have `githubIssueUrl` (prevents re-approval) | `approve` transition |
| `guard:in-design-phase` | `design-review.ts` | Current status is a design phase (Product Dev, Product Design, Bug Investigation, Tech Design) | Design review transitions |
| `guard:github-synced` | `route.ts` | Item has `githubProjectItemId` (was synced to GitHub Projects) | Routing transitions |
| `guard:not-github-synced` | `delete.ts` | Item does NOT have `githubIssueUrl` (safe to delete without force) | Delete transition |
| `guard:valid-routing-destination` | `route.ts` | Destination is in the routing map for this item type | Routing transitions |
| `guard:waiting-for-clarification` | `clarification.ts` | Item's review status is `Waiting for Clarification` | Clarification received transition |
| `guard:has-approved-review-status` | `auto-advance.ts` | Item's review status is `Approved` and status is not `Done` and status has a defined transition in STATUS_TRANSITIONS | Auto-advance transitions |
| `guard:is-single-phase` | `merge-pr.ts` | Item has no phases or single phase (`!item.artifacts?.phases \|\| phases.length <= 1`) | `merge-impl-pr` (multi-match disambiguation) |
| `guard:is-middle-phase` | `merge-pr.ts` | Item has multiple phases and current phase is not the last one | `merge-impl-pr-next-phase` (multi-match disambiguation) |
| `guard:is-final-phase` | `merge-pr.ts` | Item has multiple phases and current phase is the last one | `merge-impl-pr-final` (multi-match disambiguation) |

| `guard:auto-submit-conditions-met` | `choose-recommended.ts`, bug investigator | Agent result has `autoSubmit: true`, high confidence, S complexity, destination is implement, recommended option exists | `agent-auto-submit-investigation` (multi-match disambiguation) |

### Concurrency Guards (`pipeline/guards/concurrency-guards.ts`)

| Guard ID | Derived From | Logic | Used By |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| `guard:concurrent-version-check` | NEW | `item.statusVersion` matches `context.statusVersion` (optimistic concurrency) | All transitions (implicit) |

export function createRegistries() {
  const guards = new GuardRegistry();
  const hooks = new HookRegistry();

  // Register all guards
  for (const [id, fn] of Object.entries(itemGuards)) guards.register(id, fn);
