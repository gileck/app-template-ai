# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an AI assistant that automatically discovers and utilizes server APIs from the application's codebase. The assistant will parse the `src/apis/apis.ts` file to identify available APIs, extract their documentation and parameter information, and provide an intelligent interface for users to interact with the application through natural language commands. For example, users can say "add a todo to buy milk" or "mark the buy milk todo as complete" and the AI will automatically call the appropriate APIs with the correct parameters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the application using natural language commands, so that I can perform actions without needing to know the specific API endpoints or parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a natural language command THEN the system SHALL parse the intent and identify the appropriate API to call
2. WHEN the system identifies an API to call THEN it SHALL extract the required parameters from the user's command or request additional information if needed
3. WHEN all required parameters are available THEN the system SHALL execute the API call and return the results to the user
4. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL provide a user-friendly error message explaining what went wrong

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI assistant to automatically discover available APIs from the codebase, so that I don't need to manually configure each API endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically parse the `src/apis/apis.ts` file to discover available API handlers
2. WHEN new APIs are added to the codebase THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and include them without manual configuration
3. WHEN an API handler is removed THEN the system SHALL automatically exclude it from available operations
4. IF an API handler cannot be parsed THEN the system SHALL log a warning and continue with other available APIs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide documentation and parameter descriptions for each API, so that the AI assistant knows how to use them correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining an API handler THEN the developer SHALL be able to add JSDoc comments describing the API's purpose and parameters
2. WHEN the system discovers an API THEN it SHALL extract documentation from JSDoc comments or TypeScript type definitions
3. WHEN parameter types are defined THEN the system SHALL use them to validate user inputs before making API calls
4. IF documentation is missing THEN the system SHALL attempt to infer API behavior from parameter types and function names

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI assistant to understand context from previous interactions, so that I can have natural conversations about my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refers to previously mentioned items THEN the system SHALL maintain context to resolve references like "mark it as complete"
2. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL use previous API results to provide relevant responses
3. WHEN a conversation session ends THEN the system SHALL clear the context appropriately
4. WHEN context becomes ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive confirmations for destructive operations, so that I don't accidentally delete or modify important data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a destructive operation (delete, update) THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before proceeding
2. WHEN the user confirms a destructive operation THEN the system SHALL execute it and provide feedback
3. WHEN the user cancels a destructive operation THEN the system SHALL abort and inform the user
4. WHEN a destructive operation affects multiple items THEN the system SHALL clearly specify what will be affected

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI assistant to be extensible and maintainable, so that it can grow with the application's API surface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new API categories are added THEN the system SHALL automatically support them without code changes
2. WHEN API signatures change THEN the system SHALL adapt to new parameter requirements
3. WHEN the system encounters unknown API patterns THEN it SHALL gracefully handle them and provide fallback behavior
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of API discovery and execution processes
