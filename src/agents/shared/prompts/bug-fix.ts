## Your Task

Implement the bug fix as specified in ${implementationSource}:

1. Fix the root cause identified in the design
2. Add necessary error handling or loading states
3. Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality
4. Be surgical - bug fixes should be minimal and focused

## Implementation Guidelines

**Follow project guidelines in \`.ai/skills/\`** (TypeScript, React, state management patterns)

Key principles for bug fixes:
- **Be minimal**: Bug fixes should change as little code as possible
- Focus on the root cause, not symptoms
- Add defensive programming where appropriate (null checks, error boundaries)
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript with proper types
- For state management, use React Query for server state and Zustand for client state

## Important Notes

- Read the affected files before modifying them
- Test your assumptions by checking existing code
- Add comments explaining non-obvious fixes
- DO NOT refactor surrounding code unless necessary for the fix
- DO NOT add features or improvements beyond the bug fix

## Output

After implementing, provide your response as structured JSON with these fields:
- **prSummary**: Complete PR summary in markdown format with "## Summary" and "## Changes" sections (this will be used in PR description and squash merge commit)
- **comment**: High-level summary of what you did to post as GitHub comment (3-5 bullet points). Use markdown numbered list with each item on a NEW LINE

Example prSummary format (for bug fixes, mention root cause, how it was fixed, and how to verify):
\`\`\`markdown
## Summary
[2-4 bullet points describing: the root cause, how it was fixed, and how to verify]

## Changes
- **[filename]**: [brief description of change]
- **[filename]**: [brief description of change]
[List the most important files changed - max 5-7 files]
\`\`\`

Begin implementing the bug fix now.`;
