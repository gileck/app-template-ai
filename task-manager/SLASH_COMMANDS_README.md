# Task Management Slash Commands

Claude Code slash commands that actively implement tasks from `task-manager/tasks.md`.

## 🎯 What Are These?

Unlike CLI tools that you run manually, **slash commands make Claude actively work on tasks for you**.

- **CLI tools** (`yarn task work`): You use them to help yourself code
- **Slash commands** (`/start-task`): Claude uses them to code for you

## 📋 Available Slash Commands

### `/task-list`

**Lists all tasks organized by priority.**

```
In Claude Code:
> /task-list

Output:
📋 Tasks by Priority

🔴 Critical:
  1. Fix Cost Tracking Bug in Implementation Agent (XS)

🟠 High:
  2. Debug PR Reviewer + Claude Integration (S)
  3. Add "Ready to Merge" Status (M)
...

💡 Recommended: Start with Task 1 (Critical, XS size)
```

---

### `/start-task N`

**Claude implements task N with complete workflow.**

```
In Claude Code:
> /start-task 1

What Claude does:
✅ Creates git branch: task/1-fix-cost-tracking-bug
✅ Reads task requirements from task-manager/tasks.md
✅ Reviews CLAUDE.md guidelines
✅ Explores relevant code files
✅ Creates implementation plan (if complex)
✅ Implements the solution
✅ Runs yarn checks validation
✅ Reviews implementation
✅ Commits with proper message
✅ Pushes and creates PR
✅ Provides completion summary
```

**Example conversation:**

```
You: /start-task 1

Claude: I'll implement Task 1: Fix Cost Tracking Bug in Implementation Agent

[Claude reads task, explores code, implements solution...]

✅ Implementation complete!

Summary:
- Fixed cost tracking in implementAgent/index.ts:939
- Changed logExecutionEnd to use actual usage values
- Validation: yarn checks passed ✅
- PR created: #123

After PR merges, run: yarn task mark-done --task 1
```

---

### `/start-task-worktree N`

**Claude implements task N in a separate worktree for isolation.**

```
In Claude Code:
> /start-task-worktree 3

What Claude does:
✅ Creates worktree at ../worktree-task-3/
✅ Creates branch in worktree
✅ Symlinks node_modules (faster than yarn install)
✅ Implements task with WIP commits
✅ Returns to main worktree
✅ Squash merges into ONE clean commit
✅ Pushes to main (no PR needed)
✅ Cleans up worktree and branch

Benefits:
- Clean history: ONE commit per task
- Fast: No dependency installation, no PR review
- Work on multiple tasks in parallel
- No branch switching in main workspace
- Isolated test environments
- Keep main workspace clean
```

**When to use worktree:**
- Long-running tasks (M/L/XL size)
- Multiple tasks simultaneously
- Frequent context switching needed

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Simple Bug Fix

```
You: /task-list
Claude: [Shows task list with priorities]

You: /start-task 1
Claude: [Implements Task 1, creates PR]

[After PR merges]
You: yarn task mark-done --task 1
```

### Example 2: Working on Multiple Tasks

```
You: /task-list
Claude: [Shows 3 high priority tasks]

You: /start-task-worktree 2
Claude: [Creates worktree, implements Task 2 in isolation]

You: /start-task 3
Claude: [Implements Task 3 in main workspace]

Now you have:
- Main workspace: Task 3 implementation
- Worktree: Task 2 implementation
```

### Example 3: Review Before Implementing

```
You: /task-list
Claude: [Shows task list]

You: Show me details for task 5
Claude: [Displays task requirements]

You: /start-task 5
Claude: [Implements after you reviewed requirements]
```

## 📂 Implementation Details

### Where Are Slash Commands Defined?

Slash commands are markdown files in `.claude/commands/`:

```
.claude/commands/
├── task-list.md           (/task-list)
├── start-task.md          (/start-task)
└── start-task-worktree.md (/start-task-worktree)
```

Each file contains:
- Description (shown in command help)
- Step-by-step process for Claude to follow
- Guidelines and best practices
- Checklists for quality assurance

### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When you invoke `/start-task 1`:

1. **Task Loading**
   - Runs `yarn task work --task 1` to create branch
   - Reads task details from task-manager/tasks.md
   - Parses priority, size, complexity, implementation details

2. **Understanding Phase**
   - Reads task requirements
   - Reviews CLAUDE.md for guidelines
   - Explores files listed in "Files to Modify"

3. **Planning Phase**
   - Creates todo list for complex tasks
   - Breaks down into sub-tasks
   - Orders by dependencies

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Implements following task specifications
   - Uses code examples from task
   - Follows project patterns

5. **Validation Phase**
   - Runs `yarn checks` (TypeScript + ESLint)
   - Fixes any errors
   - Re-runs until passing

6. **Review Phase**
   - Self-reviews implementation
   - Checks for edge cases
   - Verifies requirements met

7. **Commit Phase**
   - Commits with conventional commit format
   - Includes task number reference

8. **PR Phase**
   - Pushes to remote
   - Creates PR with `yarn github-pr create`
   - Links to task in description

9. **Summary Phase**
   - Reports what was done
   - Shows PR URL
   - Reminds to mark done after merge

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Task Authors (When Writing task-manager/tasks.md)

**Good task structure:**
```markdown
## 1. Fix Cost Tracking Bug

| Priority | Complexity | Size |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Critical** | Low | XS |

**Summary:** Clear one-line description

**Current Bug Location:** Exact file and line number

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// CURRENT (broken):
logExecutionEnd(logCtx, {
    totalCost: 0,  // ← Should be from result.usage
});

// CORRECT:
logExecutionEnd(logCtx, {
    totalCost: result.usage?.totalCostUSD ?? 0,
});
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/path/to/file.ts` - Description of what to change
```

**Why this helps slash commands:**
- ✅ Clear requirements → Claude knows what to do
- ✅ Code examples → Claude knows how to do it
- ✅ File paths → Claude knows where to change
- ✅ Size estimate → Sets expectations

### For Task Implementors (When Using Slash Commands)

**Do:**
- ✅ Use `/task-list` to see priorities
- ✅ Start with highest priority tasks
- ✅ Review task details if unsure
- ✅ Let Claude handle the workflow
- ✅ Mark tasks done after PR merges

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip validation checks
- ❌ Modify task scope mid-implementation
- ❌ Mark done before PR merges
- ❌ Work on same task in multiple places

## 🔧 Integration with Other Tools

### Works With GitHub PR Tool

```bash
# Slash command creates PR automatically
/start-task 1

# But you can also manage PR manually
yarn github-pr info --pr 123
yarn github-pr comment --pr 123 --message "LGTM"
yarn github-pr merge --pr 123 --method squash
```

### Works With Agent Tools

```bash
# If task involves agent implementation
/start-task 2

# Task might use agent tools internally
yarn agent:implement --issue 123
yarn agent:pr-review --pr 123
```

### Works With Template Sync

```bash
# After implementing tasks, sync to child projects
yarn sync-children
```

## 🎯 When to Use What

### Use `/task-list`

**Always** - Start every session with this to see priorities

### Use `/start-task`

When:
- ✅ Task has clear requirements in task-manager/tasks.md
- ✅ Task follows existing patterns
- ✅ You want automated implementation
- ✅ Task size is XS, S, or M
- ✅ You trust Claude to implement

Avoid when:
- ❌ Requirements are ambiguous
- ❌ Task needs creative problem-solving
- ❌ You're learning the codebase
- ❌ Task has security implications

### Use `/start-task-worktree`

When:
- ✅ Same as `/start-task` PLUS
- ✅ Working on multiple tasks
- ✅ Long-running task (M/L/XL)
- ✅ Need isolated environment
- ✅ Frequent task switching

Avoid when:
- ❌ Quick task (XS/S)
- ❌ Limited disk space
- ❌ Single task focus

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Task not found"

```
Error: Task 99 not found

Solution: Run /task-list to see valid task numbers
```

### "yarn checks failed"

```
Claude should fix automatically, but if not:
1. Read error messages
2. Fix TypeScript errors first
3. Fix ESLint errors second
4. Ask Claude to fix: "Please fix the validation errors"
```

### "Worktree already exists"

```
The CLI automatically removes old worktrees.
If manual cleanup needed:
git worktree remove ../worktree-task-N --force
```

### "PR creation failed"

```
Check GITHUB_TOKEN is set:
1. Verify .env has GITHUB_TOKEN
2. Run: yarn verify-credentials
3. Retry PR creation
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Check task list daily**: `\task-list` shows what needs attention
2. **Batch similar tasks**: Use worktrees to work on multiple tasks
3. **Review before starting**: Read task details if you're unsure
4. **Trust the validation**: If `yarn checks` passes, implementation is likely correct
5. **Mark tasks done**: Always run `yarn task mark-done` after PR merges
6. **Use for routine work**: Slash commands excel at well-defined tasks
7. **Keep task-manager/tasks.md updated**: Good task descriptions = better implementations
