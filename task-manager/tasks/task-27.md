# Task 27: Fix PR Descriptions and Commit Messages

**Summary:** Improve the quality and consistency of auto-generated PR descriptions and commit messages produced by the workflow agents.

## Problem

Current PR descriptions and commit messages generated by agents have issues:
1. May be too verbose or too terse
2. Don't always follow conventional commit format
3. PR descriptions may lack important sections (test plan, breaking changes)
4. Commit messages may not properly reference the issue
5. Inconsistent quality across different types of changes

## Proposed Improvements

### PR Descriptions
- **Summary section** - Clear, concise description of changes
- **Test Plan** - How to verify the changes work
- **Breaking Changes** - Explicit callout if any
- **Screenshots** - For UI changes (if applicable)
- **Issue Link** - Always reference the parent issue

### Commit Messages
- Follow conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Include issue reference: `Fixes #123` or `Part of #123`
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Include body with context when needed

## Files to Modify

- `src/agents/core-agents/prReviewAgent/` - Improve commit message generation
- `src/agents/core-agents/implementAgent/` - Improve PR description generation
- Create `src/agents/shared/formatting/` - Shared formatting utilities
- Add prompt improvements for better output quality

## Implementation

1. Review current PR/commit message generation code
2. Create improved prompts for generating descriptions
3. Add validation/linting for generated messages
4. Create templates for different PR types (feature, bugfix, refactor)
5. Test with various issue types

## Notes

- PR descriptions should be ready for squash-merge without editing
- Consider adding a validation step before creating PR
- May want to use PR Review Agent to also review the description quality
